# AWS-splunk-detection-app
Because cloud and apparently people don't think I can splunk or regex despite not actually asking me if I can.

aws:cloudtrail-exfil sourcetype is based on aws:cloudtrail from the AWS splunk add-on, with some small tweaks.

current plan:
perform field extactions for honeybuckets:
https://github.com/OTRF/Security-Datasets/tree/master/datasets/atomic/aws

- Demonstrates basic understanding of regex and splunk functionality
- Demonstrates basic understanding of how the CIM model works (spoiler: I read the manual.)

create content based off of that.


add a bunch of uwu to it because I'm sure nobody is actually going to bother to look at anything UI-related and tbh I'm not gonna maintain this for compatibility once I finish, uwu.
